## Husband | Future Dad | Servant Leader | AV-IT Enthusiast | DevOps Project Manager | Concert Goer | Serious Seeker

My passion for quality, care for people, and attention to detail drives an intentionality that enhances an organization's ability to tell its unique storyâ€”without compromise and while maintaining priorities and values. Let me be a part of your story! I've had the privilege of learning and serving toward a common goal: aligning people and processes to achieve big-picture outcomes for non-profits, small businesses, and large enterprises. It's not just about the destination; it's about the journey.

At the end of the day, I strive to be known as a servant leader who is grounded, present, and enjoying that journey.
